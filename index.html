<head>hello</head>
Hey, once upon a younger year
<br><br>
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
<p>Hey, when face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

One day my father—he told me,
"Son, don't let it slip away"
He took me in his arms, I heard him say,
"When you get older
Your wild life will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid."
He said, "One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember."
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me</p>
